# My Leetcode Practice Repository

This repo is for the purpose of archiving my practice attempts of the coding questions found on [Leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/).

## Language(s) used
* Python :snake:

## Folder Structure & Navigation
The problem sets are separated into 3 folders according to their official difficulty level as seen on Leetcode
- Easy :green_circle:
- Medium :orange_circle:
- Hard 	:red_circle:

Each problem has its own sub-folder named after itself, with a _readme_ explaining the problem set in more detail.

Any self-attempted solutions done purely of my own efforts without referencing neither the ***Editorial*** nor ***Solutions*** tabs available on the problem's official page are named as such below
- self_attempt.py
- self_attempt_X.py

Attempts made with reference to any online resources are named in any fashion, e.g. _model\_answer.py_, _creative\_soln.py_, _cool\_soln_.py etc.
